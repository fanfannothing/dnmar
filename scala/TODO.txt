-Error analysis:
       -Compare soft threshold to MultiR
       -per-relation analysis (can we get more relations?)
       -better recall?
       -human evaluation...
       -TODO: need to compare training on exactly the same data (e.g. throw out 80% negative matches?)

-Compare inference methods:
	 -Random restarts (0, 10, 20)
	 -Beam search with fixed width...
	 -Measure time and % exact solutions

TODO: need some data dumping and analysis infrastructure...
-Dump out P/R points to a variety of files
-One directory per experiment
-Also list relations
Write scripts to read in dumped output and plot graphs, etc...

TODO: Evaluate MultiR and DLVM exact same dataset (e.g. don't randomly sample "NA" seperately)
